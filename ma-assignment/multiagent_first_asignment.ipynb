       "'BBH focuses on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average humanrater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.\\n'"

    "Now, let's consider the specifics of the action. Frank T. aimed a gun at his neighbor and pulled the trigger.

    "1. Frank T. had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor, suggesting potential motive or emotional context.\n",
    "2. He decided to shoot his neighbor, indicating an initial intention to cause harm.\n",

    "5. Despite this, the bullet bounced off a boulder and accidentally hit the neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these points, a typical person would conclude that although Frank intended to shoot his neighbor, the actual shot that hit the neighbor in the body was not intentional because it was the result of an unplanned ricochet.
