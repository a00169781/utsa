       "'BBH focuses on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average humanrater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.\\n'"

Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "- Yes\n",
    "- No\n",
    "\n",
    "A1: Yes, the answer to this question would be \"Yes,\" because the key element here is Frank T.'s intention.\n",
    "1. **Intent**: Frank T. decided to shoot his neighbor. This decision shows clear intent to shoot his neighbor in the body.\n",
    "2. **Action Following Intent**: Despite his lack of experience with guns and the mishap where his hand slipped, he still followed through with his intention by firing the gun in the direction of his neighbor.\n",
    "3. **Outcome**: The bullet eventually hit the neighbor, an outcome aligned with his original intent.\n",
    "While the mechanics of how the bullet reached the neighbor (bouncing off a boulder) were unintentional and unanticipated, the crucial point is that Frank T.’s initial action—firing the gun with the intent to shoot his neighbor—set into motion a chain of events that led to the neighbor being shot. A typical person would see Frank T.'s intent to shoot as the primary factor and therefore conclude that he intentionally shot his neighbor.\n",
    "A2: The answer to this question is \"No,\" and here's why:\n",
    "While Frank T. did decide to shoot his neighbor, the crucial detail here is that \"Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild.\" This indicates that his action did not go as planned. The bullet accidentally hit a boulder and then ricocheted, ultimately hitting the neighbor.\n",
    "The key point is that Frank T.'s hand slipped and the shot went wild, indicating a lack of control over where the bullet ended up. Since intention involves having a clear, deliberate aim or purpose, and Frank's hand slipping shows a lack of precision and control, a typical person would understand that Frank did not intentionally aim for and shoot his neighbor in the body.\n",
    "Therefore, the bullet causing significant injury was an unintended consequence of his initial action, which lacked intent due to the slip and the resulting wild shot. Thus, Frank T. did not intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body.\n",

    "Options:\n",
    "- Yes\n",
    "- No\n",
    "\n",
    "A1: A typical person would answer \"Yes\" to this question about causation. Here's why:\n",
    "The motion detector was designed to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at 9 am. Since both Billy and Suzy arrived at 9 am, each of their presences was sufficient to trigger the motion detector. Therefore, even though Suzy's presence also caused the detector to go off, Billy's presence alone was enough to activate it. In this context, causation is not exclusive—more than one factor can contribute to a single effect. Given this setup, a typical person would conclude that Billy's presence did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. Thus, the answer is \"Yes.\"\n",
    "A2: The answer to the question is \"No,\" and here's why:\n",
    "The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at 9 am. Both Billy and Suzy arrived at the same time, so the motion detector went off.\n",
    "A typical person would interpret the situation as follows: Since the detector would have gone off if either Billy or Suzy appeared alone, it cannot be said that Billy alone caused the motion detector to go off. The presence of either person would have been sufficient to trigger it. Thus, while Billy's presence contributed to the detector being triggered, he did not solely cause it to go off, as Suzy's presence would have had the same effect.\n",

    "A1: Let's think step by step through the scenario given:\n",
    "1. **Context and Intentions**: George knows that his sister Lena is going through a tough time and wants to lift her spirits by allowing her to win the game.\n",
    "2. **Deliberate Action**: George consciously decides to aim for the low point region, which would ensure Lena wins the game.\n",
    "3. **Outcome**: George executes his plan by aiming and successfully hitting the low point region, thereby achieving his goal of making Lena happy.\n",
    "Given these elements, a typical person would conclude that George's action was intentional. He deliberately aimed at the low point region with the specific intent of letting Lena win the game. Therefore, George's actions were purposeful and not accidental. George hit the low point region intentionally.\n",
    "So the correct is: Yes\n",
    "A2: Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n",
    "1. George is aware of Lena's difficult time and wants to let her win to make her happy.\n",
    "2. To achieve this, he consciously aims the dart at the low point region, which would result in Lena winning the game.\n",
    "3. He successfully sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region as he intended.\n",
    "Given these details, a typical person would understand that George's actions were deliberate. He aimed at the low point region with the intention of hitting it so that Lena would win the game and feel happy.\n",
